The question asks to:
1. Create a bar plot showing the duration of videos in C:\\\\Videos folder
2. Speed up all videos by 1.5x
3. Save the sped-up videos with '_fast' appended to their filenames

Breaking down the required tools:

1. First, I need to list all video files in the C:\\\\Videos folder. This requires reading file names from a directory.
   - The `read_file_names_in_local_folder` tool would be appropriate for this.

2. To create a bar plot showing video durations, I need to:
   - Get the duration of each video (using ffmpeg)
   - Create a visualization of this data
   - The `use_ffmpeg` tool can help get video information
   - The `make_custom_plot` tool can create the bar plot

3. To speed up all videos and save them with '_fast' appended:
   - Process each video file to increase playback speed
   - Save with modified filenames
   - The `use_ffmpeg` tool is appropriate for video processing tasks

The question has two parts:
1. Count how many text files (.txt) are in the folder C:\\\\\\\\Documents
2. Calculate the square root of that number, rounded to two decimal places

For the first part, I need to read the file names in a local folder and count how many have the .txt extension. The appropriate tool for this is `read_file_names_in_local_folder`.

For the second part, after I get the count, I need to calculate the square root and round it to two decimal places. The appropriate tool for this is `solve_numeric`, which can use numpy to perform the calculation.

So I'll need two tools in sequence:

2. `read_local_files` - To read the contents of the file we created

The question asks to:
1. Fetch the weather forecast for New York City from a weather website
2. Create a QR code containing the forecast details

Breaking this down:

For the first part, I need to retrieve information from a weather website. The appropriate tool for this would be `get_url_content`, which allows me to access web content from specific URLs.

For the second part, after obtaining the weather forecast, I need to create a QR code with that information. The appropriate tool for this would be `make_qr_code`, which generates a QR code from provided text.

So, the complete plan would involve:
1. Using `get_url_content` to fetch weather data from a reliable weather website
2. Using `make_qr_code` to generate a QR code containing the retrieved weather forecast information

1. The user wants to generate QR codes
2. For each file in a specific folder (C:\\\\Documents\\\\Reports)

To accomplish this, I'll need to:
- First, read the file names in the specified folder
- Then, for each file name, generate a QR code that contains that file name

1. `read_file_names_in_local_folder` - to get a list of all files in the C:\\\\Documents\\\\Reports folder
2. `make_qr_code` - to generate a QR code for each file name

2. Convert this visualization into a video (MP4 format)

For the first part, we need to use `plot_with_graphviz` which allows us to create graph visualizations using pydot (a Python interface to Graphviz).

For the second part, after creating the graph image, we would need to convert it to an MP4 video file. This would require `use_ffmpeg`, which is a tool that can manipulate videos and convert images to video formats.

So the complete tool use plan would be:

The question asks to:
1. Generate a graph visualization of a social network
2. Embed this visualization into a video
3. Add specific timestamps for each node in the video

Breaking this down into required tools:

1. For generating a graph visualization of a social network, we would need `plot_with_graphviz` which is specifically designed for graph visualizations using pydot.

2. For embedding the visualization into a video and adding timestamps, we would need `use_ffmpeg` which can manipulate videos and add timestamps.

3. We might also need to create or write files during this process, so `write_local_files` could be necessary to save intermediate files.

The main tools needed are:

The question asks us to:
1. Filter out even numbers from a list
2. Visualize the remaining (odd) numbers as a bar chart

For this task, we need:

1. A tool to handle the filtering of even numbers from the list - this requires basic programming logic
2. A tool to create a visualization (specifically a bar chart) of the filtered numbers

Looking at the available tools, I can see that:
- `make_custom_plot` would be perfect for creating the bar chart visualization
- The filtering logic can be implemented within the same function call, as `make_custom_plot` allows us to write custom Python code that can include the filtering step

We don't need any database queries, symbolic math, or other specialized tools. The entire task can be accomplished with a single tool that allows us to write custom Python code to filter the list and create the visualization.

For the first part (sorting strings), I could use `solve_with_python` since it's perfect for string manipulation tasks like sorting.

These two tools together would allow me to:
1. Sort the list of strings alphabetically
2. Create a directed graph where each node is a string and each edge points to the next string in the sorted order
