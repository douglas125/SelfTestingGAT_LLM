1. Use solve_symbolic to compute the derivative.
2. Use make_qr_code to generate a QR code for the resulting expression.

1. Generate a QR code for the given URL. This can be done using a tool that creates QR codes, which will provide the image or the necessary code to generate it.
2. Write a Python script that, when run, generates the same QR code and saves it as 'C:\\\\\\\\Scripts\\\\\\\\qr_generator.py'. This involves creating a script file with the appropriate Python code for QR code generation and saving it to the specified path.

For the first task, the make_qr_code tool is suitable, as it can generate a QR code from a given string. For the second task, the write_local_files tool is needed to write the Python script to the specified location.

2. Check the file sizes of the compressed videos to gather data points for plotting.
3. Generate a graph showing the relationship between the bitrates used and the resulting file sizes.

For step 1, the use_ffmpeg tool is necessary to perform the video compression at different bitrates.
For step 2, we will need to check the output file sizes. This can be done with solve_with_python by using Python code to get the sizes of the generated files.

This requires retrieving and parsing relevant information from the website, typically involving reading the webpage content and identifying sections or elements that describe the company's hierarchy (such as leadership, departments, reporting lines, etc.).

Once the organizational structure is extracted, the next step is to generate a visual representation of the hierarchy, which is best done using a graph visualization tool that can display nodes (representing people or roles) and edges (representing reporting relationships).

Therefore, the necessary tools are:
1. A tool to read and extract structured information from a website (to get the org structure).
2. A tool to generate a graph visualization from the extracted structure.

1. Generate a visualization of the tree data structure using Graphviz. This requires creating a graph image.
2. Convert the generated image into a video format (MP4). This requires using a video processing tool to create a video from the image.

The tools needed for these steps are:
- plot_with_graphviz: To generate the tree visualization as an image.
- use_ffmpeg: To convert the image into an MP4 video file.

Final answer:
<tool_use_plan>plot_with_graphviz:use_ffmpeg</tool_use_plan>

1. Generate a graph visualization of a social network. For this, a tool that can create custom graph visualizations is needed.
2. Embed the generated graph image into a video, adding specific timestamps for each node. This requires a tool that can manipulate video files, such as overlaying images or adding time-based effects.

For the first task, the plot_with_graphviz tool is suitable, as it allows for custom graph visualizations using pydot.

For the second task, the use_ffmpeg tool is appropriate, as it can be used to edit videos, overlay images, and manage timestamps.

Therefore, the tools required are: plot_with_graphviz and use_ffmpeg.
