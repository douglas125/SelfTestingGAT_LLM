**Explanation:**

This is a classic limit problem in calculus. The expression (x^2 - 1) / (x - 1) has an indeterminate form (0/0) when we directly substitute x = 1. However, the expression can be simplified algebraically since x^2 - 1 = (x + 1)(x - 1), which allows the (x - 1) terms to cancel.

I would provide the path to the Downloads directory as the parameter, and it will return all file names in that directory. From the returned list, I can then filter and identify files with the `.pdf` extension.

1. **Read the current user information** - I need to access the stored information about the user's friends and their ages to calculate the average age.

2. **Calculate the average age** - Once I have the friends' data with their ages, I'll need to compute the average. If the calculation is straightforward, I can use basic arithmetic, but if needed, I could use `solve_numeric` for numerical computation.

3. **Write updated user information** - After calculating the average, I need to add Alice (age 28) to the friends list and save the updated information back to the user details.

The primary tool needed is `read_write_user_details` which will be used twice (once for READ and once for WRITE). Depending on the complexity of the calculation, `solve_numeric` might also be needed for computing the average age.

I could use `solve_with_python` to calculate the Fibonacci sequence separately, then `make_custom_plot` to visualize it.

3. **Format in scientific notation with 3 significant figures** - Convert the result to scientific notation with proper precision

This is a straightforward computational task that involves basic Python programming (loops or list generation for Fibonacci sequence, arithmetic operations for the mean, and string formatting for scientific notation). The `solve_with_python` tool is designed for exactly this type of problem - it handles basic Python code including string manipulation, sorting, and numerical computations that don't require specialized libraries like numpy or sympy.

The task requires creating a QR code image from a text string (the URL). There is a dedicated tool available called `make_qr_code` that is specifically designed for this purpose. It takes text input and generates a QR code image with configurable options like box size and error correction level.

**Step 2: Generate waveform plot**
- Once the audio is extracted, I'll need to use **make_custom_plot** to create a visualization of the audio waveform. This tool allows custom Python code with numpy and matplotlib, which can be used to:
  - Read the audio file data
  - Extract amplitude values over time
  - Plot the waveform showing the audio signal

1. **Read the organizational structure data**: The file 'org_chart.txt' contains the organizational hierarchy information that needs to be loaded first. This requires the `read_local_files` tool to access and retrieve the contents of the file.

2. **Create a visual graph representation**: Once I have the organizational structure data, I need to create a hierarchical graph visualization. The `plot_with_graphviz` tool is specifically designed for creating graph visualizations using pydot, which is ideal for representing organizational hierarchies with nodes and edges showing reporting relationships.

**1. Generate a graph visualization of a social network:**
This requires creating a graph structure with nodes (representing people/entities) and edges (representing connections). The `plot_with_graphviz` tool is designed specifically for generating graph visualizations using pydot, which is ideal for social network diagrams.

**2. Embed it into a video with specific timestamps:**
After generating the graph image, I need to incorporate it into a video format with timestamp controls. The `use_ffmpeg` tool can handle video manipulation, including creating videos from images, adding overlays, and controlling timing/duration of visual elements.

**Explanation of choices:**
- `plot_with_graphviz`: Creates the social network graph visualization as an image file
- `use_ffmpeg`: Converts the graph image into a video format or embeds it with timestamp specifications, allowing control over when different elements appear or how long the video displays

1. **Filtering operation**: Remove even numbers from a list, keeping only odd numbers. This is a basic data manipulation task involving filtering/sorting operations.

2. **Visualization**: Create a bar chart to display the filtered (odd) numbers.

Looking at the available tools:

- **solve_with_python**: Explicitly designed for string manipulation, sorting, ordering, and filtering operations. This could handle the filtering of even numbers.

- **make_custom_plot**: Generates plots using Python code with numpy and matplotlib dependencies. This can create the bar chart visualization.

However, since `make_custom_plot` allows Python code execution, it can actually handle both the filtering logic AND the visualization in a single operation. The filtering can be done within the plotting code before creating the chart.

The most efficient approach would be to use only `make_custom_plot` since it can perform the filtering as part of the plotting code and then generate the bar chart.

1. **Sort the strings alphabetically** - This is a basic string manipulation and sorting task that can be handled with Python code.

2. **Generate a graph visualization** - This requires creating a directed graph where each sorted string is a node that points to the next string in the sequence.

**Tool Selection Reasoning:**

- **plot_with_graphviz**: This tool is specifically designed for generating graph visualizations using pydot. Since it accepts Python code, I can include the sorting logic directly within the graph generation code. The tool will allow me to create nodes for each string and directed edges from each string to the next one in the sorted order.

I don't need `solve_with_python` separately because the sorting can be incorporated into the graph visualization code itself. The graph visualization is the primary deliverable, and pydot code can handle both the sorting and the graph creation in one step.
