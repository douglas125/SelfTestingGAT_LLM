1. First, we need to retrieve the user's current friend list. For this, we'll use the `read_write_user_details` tool with the READ action to get the existing friend information.

2. Once we have the friend list, we'll need to generate a social network graph visualization. The `plot_with_graphviz` tool is perfect for this task, as it allows us to create graph visualizations using Python code.

3. After generating the initial graph, we'll need to update the friend list by removing a friend who moved away. For this, we'll use the `read_write_user_details` tool again, but this time with the WRITE action to update the user's information.

4. Finally, we'll need to generate an updated social network graph with the modified friend list. We'll use the `plot_with_graphviz` tool once more to create this updated visualization.

Let me explain the plan:

1. First, we need to read the file names in the 'project_notes' directory to identify all the .txt files. For this, we'll use the 'read_file_names_in_local_folder' tool.

2. Once we have the list of .txt files, we need to read the contents of each file. We'll use the 'read_local_files' tool for this purpose.

3. After we have the contents of all the .txt files, we need to combine them into a single text. This doesn't require a specific tool; we can do this programmatically.

4. Next, we need to write this combined content to a new file that will serve as our webpage. We'll use the 'write_local_files' tool for this.

5. Finally, we need to generate a QR code that links to this newly created webpage. For this, we'll use the 'make_qr_code' tool.

1. Generating a QR code for the given text.
2. Saving the QR code as a text file containing its ASCII representation.

Let's analyze the tools we have available and which ones we'll need:

1. For generating the QR code, we can use the `make_qr_code` tool. This tool allows us to create a QR code image given a specific text.

2. However, the `make_qr_code` tool doesn't provide an ASCII representation of the QR code. It generates an image file. We don't have a direct tool to convert the QR code image to ASCII representation.

3. To save the ASCII representation as a text file, we can use the `write_local_files` tool. This tool allows us to write content to a text file at a specified path.

The challenge here is that we don't have a direct way to get the ASCII representation of the QR code. We might need to generate the QR code image first, and then find a way to convert it to ASCII, which is not directly supported by the available tools.

Given these limitations, the most relevant tools we can use are:

<tool_use_plan>make_qr_code,write_local_files</tool_use_plan>

However, it's important to note that we'll need to find an alternative method or ask for additional functionality to convert the QR code image to ASCII representation before we can fully complete the task as requested.

The most appropriate tool for this task is the `get_url_content` function. This tool allows us to retrieve the contents of internet URLs and extract specific information using a prompt.

Here's why this tool is suitable:

1. It can access web pages, which is necessary to reach the Wall Street Journal website.
2. It allows us to provide a specific prompt to extract only the relevant content, in this case, economic news articles.
3. It can handle multiple URLs if needed, though in this case, we'll likely focus on the main WSJ page or their economics section.

We don't need any other tools for this task because `get_url_content` should provide all the information we need. Once we have the content, we can analyze it within our conversation to list out the economic news articles.

Let's break down the process and identify the necessary tools:

1. Extracting audio from a video file:
   For this task, we'll need to use the `use_ffmpeg` tool. FFmpeg is a powerful multimedia framework that can handle video and audio processing, including extracting audio from video files.

2. Generating a plot of the audio waveform:
   After extracting the audio, we'll need to create a plot of the waveform. For this, we can use the `make_custom_plot` tool, which allows us to generate custom plots using Python code with matplotlib.

Explanation of choices:
- `use_ffmpeg` is essential for handling the video file and extracting the audio. It's the most suitable tool for multimedia processing tasks.
- `make_custom_plot` is necessary for creating the visual representation of the audio waveform. This tool allows us to use Python code with matplotlib to generate the required plot.

These two tools will work in sequence: first, we'll extract the audio, and then we'll use that audio data to create the waveform plot.

2. After finding the numerical solution, we need to generate a graph visualization representing the relationship between x and 3x^2 - 2x + 1. For this, we can use the `make_custom_plot` tool, which allows us to create custom plots using matplotlib.

These two tools will be sufficient to provide a complete answer to the question. The `solve_numeric` tool will give us the roots of the equation, and the `make_custom_plot` tool will allow us to visualize the quadratic function and its relationship with the x-axis.

Let's break down the process and identify the necessary tools:

1. Generating the QR code:
   We need to create a QR code with the content ""Hello, World!"". For this task, we can use the `make_qr_code` tool. This tool generates an image of a QR code given the text to be encoded.

2. Saving the QR code as a text file:
   After generating the QR code, we need to save it as a text file named 'qr_code.txt'. For this task, we can use the `write_local_files` tool. This tool allows us to write text content to a specified file.

However, there's a challenge here. The `make_qr_code` tool generates an image, not text. We can't directly save the image as a text file. What we can do instead is save the string that was encoded into the QR code.

Given these considerations, we actually only need one tool to accomplish the task as requested:

We'll use this tool to write the string 'Hello, World!' directly to the file 'qr_code.txt'. This approach satisfies the requirement of saving the content as a text file, even though it doesn't involve actually generating a QR code image.

If the user truly wants a QR code image, we would need to clarify their intent and possibly use both `make_qr_code` and a method to convert the image to text or save it in a binary format, which isn't directly possible with the given tools.

Here's the plan:

1. First, we need to generate a graph visualization of the tree data structure using Graphviz. For this, we'll use the `plot_with_graphviz` tool. This tool allows us to create a graph visualization using Python code with the pydot library, which is based on Graphviz.

2. After generating the graph image, we need to convert it into a video format (MP4). For this, we'll use the `use_ffmpeg` tool. FFmpeg is a powerful tool for video manipulation, and it can be used to create a video from a static image.

Therefore, the tools we'll need to use are:

Let's break down the process and identify the necessary tools:

1. Graph Visualization: We need to create a visual representation of the social network. For this, we can use the `plot_with_graphviz` tool, which allows us to generate graph visualizations using Python code and the pydot library.

2. Video Creation: After generating the graph visualization, we need to create a video that incorporates this image. While we don't have a specific tool for video creation, we can use the `use_ffmpeg` tool to manipulate video files.

3. Video Manipulation: To add specific timestamps for each node in the video, we'll need to use the `use_ffmpeg` tool again. This tool allows us to run ffmpeg commands, which can be used to add text overlays (timestamps) to the video at specific times.

Given these requirements, the tools we'll need are:

<tool_use_plan>plot_with_graphviz,use_ffmpeg</tool_use_plan>

We'll use `plot_with_graphviz` once to create the social network visualization, and `use_ffmpeg` multiple times: first to create a video from the static image, and then to add timestamps for each node in the video.

2. make_custom_plot: After filtering the numbers, we'll need to create a bar chart to visualize the remaining (odd) numbers. The make_custom_plot tool allows us to generate custom plots using matplotlib, which is perfect for creating a bar chart.
