2. make_custom_plot: After obtaining the population data, we'll need this tool to create the bar plot showing the top 5 countries by population.

2. make_custom_plot: Once we have the population data, we need to create a visual representation of it. The make_custom_plot tool will enable us to generate a bar plot with the top 5 countries and their population figures in millions.

   - We also need to create a new video with increased speed, which is a task that FFmpeg is well-suited for.

2. write_local_files: After creating the flowchart, we'll need to create a text file containing a step-by-step description of the pizza ordering process. This tool allows us to write text content to a local file, which is exactly what we need for this task.

2. plot_with_graphviz: This tool will be used to generate a graph visualization of a social network showing connections between individuals. It uses pydot to create graph visualizations, which is ideal for representing social network connections.

These two tools together will allow us to create both the temperature variation plot and the social network graph visualization as requested in the question.

1. use_ffmpeg: This tool is essential because it provides the functionality to interact with video files. We can use it to extract metadata from 'example.mp4' by using appropriate FFmpeg commands.

2. write_local_files: Once we have the metadata, we need a way to create a new text file and write the information to it. The write_local_files tool is designed for this purpose, allowing us to create and write content to a specified file in the local file system.

By using these two tools in sequence, we can extract the video metadata and then save it to the requested text file.

2. File Renaming: After concatenation, we need to ensure the output file is named 'final_video.mp4'. FFmpeg allows us to specify the output filename directly in the command.

The use_ffmpeg tool provided in the available tools list is perfect for this task. It allows us to run ffmpeg commands with custom arguments, which is exactly what we need to concatenate the videos and specify the output filename.

We only need this one tool to complete the entire task, as it can handle both the concatenation and the naming of the final file in a single command.
