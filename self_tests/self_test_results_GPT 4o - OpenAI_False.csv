1. Solve the polynomial equation to find its roots.
2. Generate a graph that shows the polynomial and its roots.

### Tools Needed:
1. **solve_symbolic**: This tool will be used to find the roots of the polynomial equation symbolically.
2. **make_custom_plot**: This tool will be used to create a graph that represents the polynomial and its roots.

### Explanation:
- **solve_symbolic**: The polynomial equation \\\\(x^3 - 6x^2 + 11x - 6 = 0\\\\) is a symbolic equation. To find its roots, I need to solve it symbolically.
- **make_custom_plot**: Once I have the roots, I need to visualize the polynomial and its roots on a graph. This requires custom plotting capabilities to accurately depict the relationships.

For the first task, I will use the `read_file_names_in_local_folder` tool to list all files in the folder `C:\\\\\\\\Movies`. This will help identify which files are video files.

For the second task, I will use the `use_ffmpeg` tool to extract the 30-second clip from each video file, starting at the 1-minute mark.

The tools needed are:
