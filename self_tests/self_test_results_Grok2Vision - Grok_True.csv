To answer the user's question about calculating the average daily temperature and creating a line plot, we need to perform two main tasks:

1. **Calculate the Average Temperature**: This requires performing a mathematical operation on the given list of temperatures. The tool `solve_numeric` is suitable for this task as it can handle numerical computations using numpy.

2. **Create a Line Plot**: After calculating the average, we need to visualize the temperature trend over the week. The `make_custom_plot` tool is ideal for this since it can generate plots using matplotlib, which is commonly used for creating line plots.

Given these requirements, the tools needed are `solve_numeric` for the calculation and `make_custom_plot` for the visualization.

To answer the question about calculating the Fibonacci sequence up to the 20th term and creating a line plot, we need to perform two main tasks:

1. **Calculate the Fibonacci Sequence**: This involves generating a sequence of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones. Since this is a mathematical operation, we should use a tool that can handle such calculations efficiently. The `solve_with_python` tool is suitable for this as it can run Python code to perform the calculation.

2. **Create a Line Plot**: After calculating the sequence, we need to visualize it. The `make_custom_plot` tool is designed for generating plots using Python code, which includes the necessary libraries like matplotlib for creating line plots.

Therefore, the tools needed are `solve_with_python` for the calculation and `make_custom_plot` for the visualization.

To answer the user's question about generating a QR code with the first paragraph of today's top news story, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Retrieve the Content**: First, we need to find the content of today's top news story from a major news website. This requires fetching data from the internet, which can be done using the `get_url_content` tool.

2. **Extract the First Paragraph**: Once we have the content, we need to extract the first paragraph. This can be done through text processing, which might involve using `solve_with_python` for string manipulation.

3. **Generate QR Code**: Finally, we need to generate a QR code from the extracted text. This step involves the `make_qr_code` tool.

Given this reasoning, the tools needed are `get_url_content`, `solve_with_python`, and `make_qr_code`.

To answer the question about the integral of \\\\( f(x) = x^2 \\\\) from 0 to 10, we need to perform symbolic integration, which requires the `solve_symbolic` tool. For plotting the function \\\\( f(x) = x^2 \\\\), we would use the `make_custom_plot` tool. Here's the reasoning:

- **solve_symbolic**: This tool is necessary for solving the integral of \\\\( x^2 \\\\) from 0 to 10, as it involves symbolic mathematics which cannot be solved purely numerically.
- **make_custom_plot**: This tool will be used to generate a visual representation of the function \\\\( f(x) = x^2 \\\\), which is a straightforward plotting task.

Since both tasks are distinct and require different tools, we'll list them separately.

1. **Retrieve the current exchange rate**: This requires accessing real-time financial data, which can be done by fetching information from a reliable financial website or API. The tool `get_url_content` is suitable for this task as it can retrieve content from internet URLs, which would include financial data like exchange rates.

To answer the user's request, we need to perform two distinct tasks:

1. **Creating a QR Code**: The user has requested to create a QR code for the text 'Hello, World!'. This requires a tool specifically designed for generating QR codes. The appropriate tool for this task is `make_qr_code`.

2. **Generating a Family Tree Graph**: The user also wants a graph visualization of a family tree. This involves creating a visual representation of relationships, which can be achieved with a graph visualization tool. The suitable tool here is `plot_with_graphviz`.

Both tasks require specific tools that are designed for their respective purposes, ensuring accuracy and efficiency in the output.

To answer the user's question about loading an organizational structure from a text file and creating a visual representation, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Read the File**: We need to read the contents of 'org_chart.txt' to extract the organizational structure data. This requires a tool to read local files.

2. **Create a Graph**: After reading the file, we need to convert this data into a visual graph. This involves using a tool that can generate graph visualizations.

Based on these steps, the appropriate tools would be:
- **read_local_files** to read the content of the 'org_chart.txt' file.
- **plot_with_graphviz** to create a visual representation of the organizational hierarchy using graph visualization.
