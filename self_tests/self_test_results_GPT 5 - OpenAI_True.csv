For the visual representation of their hierarchical structure, a graph visualization tool is appropriate to depict the folder as a root node with file nodes (and potentially subfolders if needed) as children. Therefore:
- Use read_file_names_in_local_folder to retrieve the file names.
- Use plot_with_graphviz to generate a hierarchical graph image from those names.

Running tools in parallel isn’t suitable because the graph depends on the file list.

Since there’s no dedicated rename tool, a simple Python snippet using os.rename via the generic Python execution tool is appropriate and lightweight.
