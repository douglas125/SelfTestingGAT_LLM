The process involves specifying the input videos and the desired output file name in the ffmpeg command.

1. **plot_with_graphviz**: This tool will be used to generate the visualization of the tree structure using Graphviz. It allows for the creation of graphical representations of data structures.

2. **use_ffmpeg**: After generating the visualization, this tool will be needed to convert the output image from Graphviz into an MP4 video format. FFmpeg is a powerful tool for video processing.

The combination of these tools will effectively create the desired video visualization of the tree data structure.

1. For filtering the even numbers from the list, we can use a simple Python code snippet to iterate through the list and select only the odd numbers.
2. For visualizing the remaining numbers as a bar chart, we will use a plotting tool that can generate a bar chart from the filtered list.

Thus, the tools required for this task are:
- A tool to execute Python code for filtering the numbers.
- A tool to generate a bar chart visualization.

The specific tools needed are:
- `solve_with_python` for filtering the numbers.
- `make_custom_plot` for creating the bar chart.

These two tools will allow us to complete the tasks of sorting the strings and visualizing the relationships between them.
