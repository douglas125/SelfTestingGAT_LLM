1. A tool to create a graph visualization, as the question asks for a visual representation of a family tree.
2. A tool to save the graph image, as the question implies that the user wants to view the image.

The tool to create a graph visualization is likely to be <tool_name>plot_with_graphviz</tool_name>, as it is used to generate a graph visualization using the provided custom Python code. The tool to save the graph image is likely to be <tool_name>make_custom_plot</tool_name>, as it is used to generate an image or plot using the provided custom Python code.

However, I need to confirm if the user wants to generate a graph visualization before calling this tool. If the user didn't specifically ask for a graph visualization, I should ask if they want to generate a graph visualization before calling this tool.

I must follow the <tool_guidelines></tool_guidelines>. I need the following tools: do_date_math, as it will allow me to add or subtract a certain number of days from a given date, which will be useful to find the date when the company will have 650 employees. Additionally, I need do_date_math to calculate the total number of employees 5 years from today. I will use do_date_math to find the growth rate of the employees, and then add 5 years to the current date to find the total number of employees. I can use do_date_math to add the growth rate to the current date. However, I will need to first calculate the growth rate. I can do this by using do_date_math to find the total number of days between the current date and the date when the company will have 800 employees. Then, I can use do_date_math to find the growth rate per day, and finally, use do_date_math to find the total number of employees 5 years from today. The tools I need are: do_date_math:do_date_math:do_date_math. However, I will need to call do_date_math three times, and then use the results of the first call to make the second call, and use the results of the second call to make the third call. I will need to call do_date_math three times, so the final answer is: <tool_use_plan>do_date_math:do_date_math:do_date_math</tool_use_plan>. However, I can simplify this by calling do_date_math only once, and using the results to make the other two calls. I will call do_date_math once to find the growth rate, and then use the results to make the other two calls. The final answer is: <tool_use_plan>do_date_math</tool_use_plan>.

I will use solve_symbolic to find the symbolic solution for the system of equations. Then, I will use use_ffmpeg to create a 15-second video that transitions between two images: one showing the equations, and another showing the solution point on a coordinate plane.

The solve_symbolic function will take the system of equations as input and return the symbolic solution. The use_ffmpeg function will take the two images and the transition time as input and return the created video.

I will use the output of solve_symbolic as one of the images in the video, and I will create another image showing the solution point on a coordinate plane. Then, I will use use_ffmpeg to transition between these two images.

I will not use any other tools, as they are not necessary to answer the question.

The final answer is: <tool_use_plan>solve_symbolic:use_ffmpeg</tool_use_plan>",['solve_symbolic:use_ffmpeg'],"['solve_symbolic', 'use_ffmpeg']"
